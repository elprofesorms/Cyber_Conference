                    <div class="one">
                        <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it
                            doesn’t end with neckties,
                            PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations
                            that enable good work to get done,
                            or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and
                            for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows
                            it to succeed.</p>

                        <p>In Kamal's session he will explore how to recognize the trails of organizations and how to
                            fix it. He will share what those teams,
                            departments, and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to
                            change your own workplace’s culture. Once
                            you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere
                            else.</p>

                    <div class="one">
                        <p>Script applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS,
                            Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that
                            our code is ready for production? This talk will share tips on how writing tests can be
                            written easily and quickly and how to remove
                            buggy code through testing.</p>

                        <p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the
                            technical aspects used in film to communicate.
                            We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and
                            storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and
                            how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

                    <div class="one">
                        <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little
                            better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes
                            or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                            is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and
                            improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>
